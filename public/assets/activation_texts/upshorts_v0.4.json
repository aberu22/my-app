Trigger: upshortsYou can use the trigger in combination with panties-related tags, especially when the effect is not immediately visible or too imperceptible. E.g.: panties, white panties, pink panties, lace panties, bikini. Note that it only works with certain angles, as you it would be expected from what the concept is looking to represent. Although you don't often need to prompt the right angle for the effect, you may need to nudge the prompt in that direction. See my example images.",
