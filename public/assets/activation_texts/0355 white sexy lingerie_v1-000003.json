    "description": "I played SD too late last night. I slept all day today. When I got up in the afternoon, I still had to make up for my children\u2019s winter vacation homework. Alas.\n\nCloser to home, I especially want to create an underwear series, and find some underwear clothing that is difficult to express with prompt words or is relatively complicated.\n\nThis time I will make a polka dot underwear first. If the response is good, I will continue to make underwear. If it is mediocre, I will continue to look for more interesting clothes.\n\n\n\nThere is almost no difference.",
