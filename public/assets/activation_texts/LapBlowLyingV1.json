    "description": "V2 (Illustrious/NoobAI) Information:This one is meant to be used at 1.0 strength. No more, no less. (Not compulsory, feel free to experiment).The trigger words are also a bit different this time around, and having the man in the frame can be kind of difficult. Refer to the prompts in the showcase images for a better idea on how to correctly prompt for different situations. Some of the information in the v1 section may also be relevant for this one.All showcase images are made on tensor with 25 steps initial, 25 steps hires with latent upscale at 0.4 denoise, and adetailer for the faces. They also use SGM_uniform with DPM++ SDE. A latent upscale hires fix does wonders for the gen, and I find that only possible to do online on Tensor. If you want to run it there, here is the LINK https://tensor.art/models/795875582161350006.head on lap, penis in mouth, oral, fellatio, from side,Charging a very little amount for buzz per download for a very limited time to fund development of Illustrious versions of my other LoRAs.Models like Pasanctuary and AAA break some LoRAs. This is one of them (not thoroughly tested). Use WAI-NSFW-Illustrious https://civitai.com/models/827184?modelVersionId=1045121 for online civit gens. For local gens, I recommend Illustrious Pencil https://civitai.com/models/838773/illustriouspencil-xl, I love the details in that one.V1 (PONY) Information:For this one, try not going over 0.95 strength. The LoRA supports both 1216 x 832 and 1344 x 768. Don't go above or below this resolution. 0.9 is the optimal strength to use.If you want to have the man's face in the image you gen, just include \"staring, smiling,\" after 1man in your prompt (or just refer to the gallery images with male faces in them). Please follow the prompting method below to get better gens. Also, portrait resolutions don't work.NOTE: If you choose to include the man's face in your gen, it may bleed facial features from the girl's face. Some inpainting should fix this.Follow this prompting style for best results (checked with minimal testing) (Mostly relevant for v1 only):First Part (LoRA trigger): 1man, face out of frame (OPTIONAL), sitting, girl on lap, penis in mouth, bl0wjob,1girl, head on lap,Second Part (Example description of girl): 1girl, snow, pointy ears, twintails, green eyes, outdoors, elf, long hair, white capelet, solo, winter, white hair, hand on ass (OPTIONAL), lap lying blowjob,Third Part (Background details and other stuff): outdoors, very dark night, purple clouds, night, on sofa, balcony, dark, lake, aesthetic, beautifulIf you are using A1111/Forge, and the LoRA does not show up, you can force it to appear by enabling the \"Always show all networks on the Lora page\" option on the settings page. (Thanks to @pr0log https://civitai.com/user/pr0log for pointing this out).Usually, 0.9 strength works best, but if you are having problems with the style, lower to 0.85 (lowers chance of guaranteed pose). If the girl's body anatomy gets wonky, lower the character LoRA weight by 0.5 at a time, until it gets fixed.If you want to support more models like this, or you just like what you see: ko-fi  https://ko-fi.com/nottheninja(\uff61\u2665\u203f\u2665\uff61)--Reserved for Future Updates and Observations--",
