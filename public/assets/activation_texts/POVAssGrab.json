    "description": "This is a LoRA for POV Ass Grab.I suggest using this LoRA at 0.6-1.0 weight for best results.Use CLIP SKIP 2. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UKHpGHepq4AThis was trained on NAI. NAI-based models will give the best results.Tested on AOM2 (Worked), AOM3 A1 (Worked), 7th Anime (Worked), Pastel Mix (Worked), My Own Mix (Worked), Corneo's 7th Heaven Mix (Worked), Chillout Mix (Kinda Worked), Dreamshaper (Doesn't Work).Always add this to the prompt with the LoRA to activate it properly: povag, pov hands, ass grabAdd the tags: pussy, spread pussy to spread her pussy.Add the tags: lying, on stomach - To make her lay down.Add the tag: from below to grab her ass from below.Just adding pussy, anus gives slightly different results.Try other other descriptive tags - It might give you interesting results.Known IssuesIf it has issues with character LoRAs, try lowering the character's weight - This is how I fixed it.If it's changing the style too much - Just lower the weight of the Ass Grab LoRA to 0.6-0.7 to fix it. It's slightly overbaked.If you don't describe anything (hairstyle, hair color, clothing) and only have base tags - It will only generate her ass and nothing else sometimes.Sometimes her ass will fuse with panties or clothing when using pussy, anus, or spread pussy tags. You can add bottomless or cameltoe to fix this.Anus, Spread Anus - doesn't work too well compared to Pussy, Spread Pussy tags.If you have issues with the eyes - Upscale or add looking back, looking at viewer to help the AI generate them better.This is only V1 - It will have it's issues but will be updated in the future with V2.Embeds and LoRAs usedBad Prompt https://huggingface.co/datasets/Nerfgun3/bad_prompt - Ekune Style LoRA https://civitai.com/models/17496/ekune-style-loraFollow me on Twitter for updates- https://twitter.com/TrueHeroBang https://twitter.com/TrueHeroBangEverything I'm making will always be free but if you want to show a little bit more support, you can buy me a coffee - https://ko-fi.com/ekune https://ko-fi.com/ekune",
