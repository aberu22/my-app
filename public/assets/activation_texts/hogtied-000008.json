Start here. https://civitai.com/articles/4451/how-to-beat-the-odds-against-the-random-noiseIf you love my work: Consider supporting the cause ;) https://ko-fi.com/joschekThis seems to produce fairly good results now. Still may break some bones and screw up some occasionally, but I'm quite happy where i got with this model.If you can't get good results with this model: Try the following steps:-change your checkpoint. Some have an easier time with this pose than others-clean up your prompt. try getting the pose to work first and then selectively add your desired elements back in.-clean out your other lora: some of them may fight with this model and none of them will win.-as always: try higher steps, lower cfg. Upscaling will probably not save you on this one though. Don't Upscale before you have a decent base.-use some of the tags belowTaglistTo get the model to understand what's what, some pretty extensive manual tagging was necessary. Now the lora has a pretty long list of charged tags, that you may use (with varying effectiveness) in positive or negative: (don't go overboard though;)Perspective: From above | from side | from angle | facing viewer -- these may also be combined(From behind confused the model to much so it was removed from the dataset)Setting: On floor | on ground | on table | on bed ...Pose: arched back | head down | head back | feet crossed | feet together | knees together | knees apart feet together | elbows together | hands together elbows apartBondage related: (color) + gag | (color) + rope | natural rope | feet linked to hands | feet linked to shoulders | feet linked to hair | bound + (bodypart)Good Luck andmay the RNG-Gods bless you with the perfect seed",
